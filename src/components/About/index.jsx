              Our logo is a <strong>colorful bagel</strong>, which carries
              symbolic significance from various legends and beliefs. In many
              cultures, the bagel is considered a symbol of unity, completeness,
              and the cycle of life. It is often associated with good fortune,
              abundance, and protection from harm. Some legends even suggest
              that the shape of the bagel represents the infinite possibilities
              and interconnectedness of the Universe.
